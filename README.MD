# MyRaytracer Project

This project is based on the [TinyRaytracer Wiki by ssloy](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki), which Iâ€™m using as a learning reference.

# Project Goals

- **Refresh my C++ skills**: I haven't used C++ for over a year, so this project serves as a hands-on way to recover my coding proficiency.
  
- **Inprove my English Skill**: All code/Study Note will be commented in English to improve technical writing skills and prepare for future global collaboration.

- **Supplementary notes**: Due to my current English level, some complex concepts may include brief Chinese notes(Or Japanese) for self-reference.

- For ray algorithm and corresponding material parameters

## sphere.c

- framebuffer is a 1dim array of Vec3f values, give us (r,g,b) values for each pixel.
